        <p>Having evolved in isolation for 80 million years, New Zealand's natural heritage is radically different from the rest of the world.</p>

        <p>
            Our native plants, animals and wild places are like no others on this planet. Yet it has taken humans less than a thousand years to wipe out a significant amount of this natural heritage.
            The burning of forests and tussock grasslands, the introduction of pests, the draining of wetlands, and loss of habitat through development are just some of the major factors that have contributed to more than 50 extinctions.
            Nature on land is still in crisis, despite a growing number of initiatives to expand pest control and restore habitats.
            Our native plants and animals are continuing to decline across the country, with over 80% of our land-based birds, bats, reptiles and frogs in trouble.
            A third of New Zealandâ€™s land is public conservation land, managed by the Department of Conservation. In these areas, nature appears superficially intact, but forests are being degraded by pests, and in many places wildlife is still disappearing.
            On private land, native habitat is also continuing to disappear due to pressure from development, leaving tiny, disconnected fragments.
